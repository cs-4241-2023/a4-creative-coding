Conway's Game of Life

http://a4-bright183.glitch.me

A simple Implementation of Conway's Game of Life using HTML (Canvas) and JavaScript. 
Using Express as the server with a local host port 3000.
I felt that the hardest challenge with this project was deciding how I wanted to determine the location of each cell and how I wanted them to be alive or dead. In the end I decided to use a two dimensional array that has the value true or false to decide if each of the cells are dead or alive.
