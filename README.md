Assignment 4 - Creative Coding: Interactive Multimedia Experiences
===

I choose to do the D3 option for this asignmemt. I was having some issues using the examples from the d3js site so I built a scatter plot based on other d3 resources out there. The scatter plot uses the Pokedex JSON file under the Gaming section of the JSON data file GitHug page linked in the assignment. It graphs the height and weight of each of the original 151 pokemon. When you hover over one of the points it tells you the pokemon's name, height and weight and displays an image.
