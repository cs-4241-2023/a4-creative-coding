The visualizer is four spheres moving in a circle which scale with the volume of the music. User clicks start button to start music. Then user can click and drag with standard orbit controls to change view and scrolling zooms in and out of the scene. Then user can click spacebar to play/pause music.

Goal: Create a 3D scene with multiple shapes which scale with volume of music. When the music is louder, the shapes get larger and when the music is softer, the shapes get smaller. 

Challenges: Yes
