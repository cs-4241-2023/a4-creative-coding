- the goal of the application: a simple drawing/coloring app with a few options for coloring pages, coloring functionality, eraser, clearability, and ability to control line width.
- challenges you faced in realizing the application: had issues with figuring out how to render the SVGs to the right size, how to get the drawing line to line up with my mouse, and the overall css layout. 
- No instructions are provided as it is a basic drawing app which I imagine all people who have use the internet know how to use.
