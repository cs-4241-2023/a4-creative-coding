## Retro Soundscape

The goal of my application was to make a space where you can create basic harmonies online. The user can pick from a number of musical scales to play notes from, and layer them on top of one another. With tons of combinations of notes, mixed with different types of sound waves and distortion effects, the user can make beautiful melodies and horrible, ungodly sounds as well.

Some of the challenges I faced while making this application were figuring out what to make the application about, keeping track of audioContext objects and when to create and stop different sounds, and figuring out how to draw to the canvas. At first I knew I wanted to make a music-based application, but once I created a basic musical interface, I didn't know what diretion I wanted to take the project. Once I decided to layer sounds on top of one another by keeping them in JSON objects, I then made that the goal of the project and solved my first two issues. Drawing to the canvas was difficult for me becuase I wanted to keep the visual of each active sound wave on the screen while they were playing, so I had to conglomerate the results from each active wave and append them to the canvas at each draw step.
