## MINI WEBSITE PIANO

Hosting Link: https://a4-ksmangone.glitch.me

- The goal of this application was to recreate a simple piano like instrument on a webpage using Web Audio API. Each note has an assigned frequency that I got from https://mixbutton.com/mixing-articles/music-note-to-frequency-chart/ to help implement the proper note for each key. This keyboard only has the 3rd and 4th octave but could be easily adjusted to add more or put in the 1st and 2nd. Simply press the key with mouseclick, or press the corresponding labeled key on your keyboard to play a key. There is also a tweakpane pane to adjust the background color for added fun!

- A clear challenge I faced with this application is that the keyboard very clearly does not sound like a piano, it is more based on the appropriate frequencies that a keyboard has. The audio is more digital than a real piano would make, taking away from the project a little. Furthermore, I was not too familiar with Web Audio API but was able to learn as I went along building the piano.

- The instructions are pretty obvious. Press the keys with mouseclick, or simply press the labeled button on your keyboard. There is a spacebar button to stop all audio. The tweakpane pane automatically adjusts the background color based on the RGB values you adjust. The title is automatically adjusted to be the direct opposite of the background so it is always visible.
