            <h3>Playing Sounds</h3>
            <p>To start playing a sound, click the <u>Start/Stop</u> button at the top of the page, and press the button again to stop the sound.</p>
            <p>You can play different musical notes by pressing different keys on the keyboard - check the <u>key bindings</u> on the right side of the page.</p>
            <p>Use the right and left arrow keys to go up or down an octave on the musical scale</p>
            <p><u>Change the scale of the notes</u> played by entering the letter of the scale you would like to play into the <i>Musial Scale</i> field. Use capitals for major keys and lowercase for minor keys.</p>
            <p>Ex: to play in D major, enter and submit "D", to play F minor, enter "f".</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Saving Sounds</h3>
            <p>Once a sound is playing, to keep it playing while creating another, click the <u>Save Sound</u> button on the right side of the screen.</p>
            <p>Once this is done, press the <u>Start/Stop</u> button to make a new sound.</p>
            <p>To <u>Delete</u> a saved sound, simply press the <i>Delete</i> button, and the most recently saved soundwave will stop playing</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Editing Sound and Visuals</h3>
            <p>Sliders:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Volume</i>: Controls the volume of the current soundwave</li>
                <li><i>Distortion</i>: Controls the distortion of the current soundwave</li>
                <li><i>Flatline Rotation</i>: Controls the rotation of the visuals when in "Flatline" mode</li>
                <li><i>VertSlider</i>: Offsets vertical placement of "Flatline" visuals and makes "Droopy Mountain" visuals a little squiggly</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <u>sine wave</u> button controls the wave type of the soundwave, and clicking it will go through four options for a wave: sine, sawtooth, triangle, and square</p>
            <p>The <u>Droopy Mountain</u> button changes the visual representation of the waves from being with rectangles, to with elipses</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Key Bindings</h3>
            <p>The default key bindings are set up for the keys: [z, x, c, v, m, ,, ., /]</p>
            <p>To change that, enter in the eight new keys to bind the notes to in the provided space separated by only whitespace.</p>
