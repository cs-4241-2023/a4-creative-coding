            <p>Elixir Chess is a variant of realtime chess.</p>
            <p>Movement is restricted in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A piece is put on "cooldown" after it is moved, and cannot be moved again for 2 seconds. This is denoted by the piece appearing transparent.</li>
                <li>An elixir/mana bar slowly fills up over time, and a piece can only be moved if you have enough elixir to cover its "move cost".</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The move cost of each piece is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Queen - 9</li>
                <li>Rook - 5</li>
                <li>Bishop - 3</li>
                <li>Knight - 3</li>
                <li>Knight - 3</li>
                <li>King/Castling - 2</li>
                <li>Pawn - 1</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Pieces are moved by clicking and dragging them to a new square.
                A move will only be considered "valid" if it is a legal chess move, the piece is not on cooldown, and the required elixir cost is satisfied.
            </p>
            <p>
                This game does not include a "check/checkmate" mechanic due to the realtime nature of the game.
                Instead, the game is won when a piece is able to capture the enemy king.
